## Free introductory coaching session

For a limited time, I am offering all new clients the chance to have one free life coaching session. No, there are no strings attached. If you decide that one session was all you needed then congratulations and I'm glad I could help. Please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> now if you want to take advantage of this offer.
    
## Phone, video-call, or in person

I coach people in one hour sessions. I do this over the phone and by video call (Skype, Facetime, WhatsApp, VSee, whatever works for you.) I also coach people face to face in Chorlton-cum-Hardy in Manchester. I'd love to hear from you if you think you might benefit from life coaching.
