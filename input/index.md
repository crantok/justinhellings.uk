<h2>Free life coaching available</h2>
<p>We all need support to help us achieve what we want in life. Sometimes we even need help to figure out what exactly it is that we do want! If you want more out of life, and you are willing to put the work in to make that change, then I want to help you.</p>
<p>You might feel that you are not organised enough or not confident enough in order to make the changes in your life that you would like. Most of us feel that way about ourselves from time to time. This doesn't have to stop you. As a life coach, I can help you to tackle the things that are getting in your way.</p>
<p>I am currently coaching people for <a href="/prices">no charge</a> while I build up my life coaching business. Please get in touch if you would like to take advantage of this offer.</p>
<p>I coach people in <a href="/about-life-coaching">one hour sessions</a>, both over the phone and by video call (Skype, Facetime, WhatsApp.) I also coach people face to face in Chorlton-cum-Hardy in Manchester. I'd love to hear from you if you think you might benefit from life coaching. Have a look below to see the different ways to get in contact with me.</p>
