        <p>I want to empower as many people as I can to live the lives they want. I find it incredibly satisfying when my coachees realise that what they want is achievable and I want to do this for you.</p>
        <p>My previous career was in computer programming and website development, mainly for community and charity organisations and cooperatives. Preferring to work with humans rather than machines, I started looking for a change of career. In 2017, I took the <a href="//www.centreforcoaching.com/cert-in-coaching">Certificate in Coaching</a> course at the <a href="//www.centreforcoaching.com/">Centre for Coaching</a>. Energised and inspired by the experience of coaching others, I am now moving over to coaching full time. This is the most rewarding work I have ever done.</p>
