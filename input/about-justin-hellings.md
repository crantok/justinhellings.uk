        <p>I want to empower as many people as I can to live the lives they want. I find it incredibly satisfying when the people I work with realise that what they want is achievable, and I want to do this for you.</p>
        <p>My previous career was in computer programming and website development, mainly for community and charity organisations and cooperatives. Preferring to work with humans rather than machines, I started looking for a change of career.</p>
        <p>In 2017, I earned the Certificate in Coaching qualification at the <a href="//www.centreforcoaching.com/">Centre for Coaching</a>. Energised and inspired by the experience of coaching others, I am now moving over to coaching full time. This is the most rewarding work I have ever done.</p>

I am currently in my second year of study for a diploma in Gestalt therapy at the <a href="//mgc.org.uk">Manchester Gestalt Centre</a>. Although therapy is significantly different from life coaching, this ongoing education is very helpful in my coaching work. Partly this is because a lot of skills practice (listening, non-judging and many others) directly benefit my coaching work. It also helps because I am continually working on my own self-development, which is incredibly valuable for working with other people.
