        <p>I want to empower as many people as I can to live the lives they want. I find it incredibly satisfying when the people I work with realise that what they want is achievable, and I want to do this for you.</p>
        <p>My previous career was in computer programming and website development, mainly for community and charity organisations and cooperatives. Preferring to work with humans rather than machines, I started looking for a change of career.</p>
        <p>In 2016  I completed the foundation year of training in Gestalt therapy at the <a href="//mgc.org.uk">Manchester Gestalt Centre</a>. Although therapy is significantly different from life coaching, I did get a lot of practice in skills (listening, non-judging and many others) that directly benefit my coaching work. In 2017, I took the Certificate in Coaching course at the <a href="//www.centreforcoaching.com/">Centre for Coaching</a>. Energised and inspired by the experience of coaching others, I am now moving over to coaching full time. This is the most rewarding work I have ever done.</p>
