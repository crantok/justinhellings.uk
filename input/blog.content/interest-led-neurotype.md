:teaser: Do you find you can focus for hours on something in which you feel great interest, maybe forgetting to eat or sleep? Is trying to concentrate on something less interesting like wading through treacle? Maybe you have interest-led neurotype.

### Highs and lows

People with interest-led neurotype (ILN) experience the world differently from most people. ILN brings some benefits. When your thinking is led by your moment-to-moment interest, your intuition can take you to places that other people might never get to. This is potentially a big help in creative problem solving. Additionally, when something *really* grabs your attention you might find that you can stay focussed on it for many hours, losing sense of time, sometimes forgetting to eat or to go to bed.

There may be downsides too. If you really do forget to eat or sleep or stick to arrangements that you've made with other people then your self-care might be lacking, your health might suffer and your life might feel chaotic. If nothing currently pulls your interest into that zone of intense focus then your thoughts might bounce around all over the place, rarely settling for long, and making it hard to concentrate on mundane day-to-day needs. Things that most people take for granted can become very challenging: Where did I leave my keys? You asked me to do what? You want me to read this now, while you wait?

### Feeling as much as thinking

Something that goes hand-in-hand with interest-led neurotype is emotional hyperarousal; feeling emotions intensely in response to stimuli that other people probably consider unremarkable. Sometimes this manifests as intense excitement about something that grabs your interest in the moment. It can also mean that you feel failure and rejection very deeply.

Some common things may inspire such intense emotion that you can find yourself in fight-or-flight mode (where biochemical processes prepare you to fight, flee, freeze or submit.) This is potentially very confusing. Imagine that a friend snaps at you for being clumsy or asking one-too-many questions, and immediately you freeze and find it difficult to think coherently. What's going on in this situation? Did you do something life threatening? Is your friend out to get you? Sometimes fight-flight in response to everyday stimuli can be the legacy of trauma, however interest-led neurotype might be enough reason on its own.

### An evolutionary gift

If interest-led neurotype sounds like a mixed bag of positives and negatives then it is. Like all relatively common human traits (at least 4% of people have ILN) it is adaptive in certain situations. Imagine living in a small pre-technological community where you are sometimes predator and occasionally prey. If you have a restless attention and react powerfully to stimuli then you are likely to be the first one to notice threats to your group. Your way of being saves lives. In addition, if you have a roaming curiosity and the ability to focus intensely on novel and challenging things then you are very likely to be the one who comes up with innovations that make the life of your community easier. People with ILN are still creating and innovating today. As a group they punch above their weight in this respect.

### So why am I only hearing about this now?

If you haven't heard of interest-led neurotype then that is not surprising. I don't know whether the term ILN is used anywhere other than this article yet. The medical profession have named it after a set of behaviours that annoy caregivers and teachers. They call it Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. I think it is a very stupid name, a name for challenging children. Many people don't find out they have this condition until adulthood. Most of all I think it is stupid because it is called a disorder. ILN is a way of being that was highly adaptive until very recently (in evolutionary time) and is only problematic now because civilisation has rigidly crystalised around the rhythms and expectations of neurotypical people. Many people with ILN suffer from anxiety and/or depression because our world has been built around a way of life tailored to other people.

### Thriving in an alien world

This world may have been built for someone else, but those of us with ILN can still thrive in it. In order to succeed, we might need help; the support of friends, loved ones and other people with ILN. Maybe psychological and/or pharmacological help. Many people diagnosed with ADHD feel that they benefit from medication (stimulants and/or an alpha-agonist) in order to stabilise their attention and mood.

Once you start looking, you will quickly find a lot of people with this neurotype. Since realising a few weeks ago that I have ADHD, I have been nosing around the internet meeting other people with the same condition. As a group they are a wonderful, generous-hearted community, a great source of support, and I feel very honoured to be one of them.
