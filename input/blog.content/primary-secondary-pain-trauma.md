Hi Alex. What's up?

Hi J. I read something that mentioned primary and secondary pain and I was wondering what they were.

Do you have an idea of what they might be?

I thought maybe primary pain was what you had when something painful happened and secondary pain was from remembering painful things.

That's in the ball park. Primary and secondary pain are often mentioned in explaining mindfulness. Primary pain is your physical and emotional response to a painful event; the physical pain and shock of falling over, the sadness of losing a loved one, the anger you feel when someone pushes you out of the way.

So am I right that primary pain is what you feel at the time that the painful thing happens?

In a way, but this kind of pain is not always short lived. For example, the loss of someone you love can be painful for a long time. It may be that it never fully goes away.

So, if primary pain is your physical and emotional reaction, then what is secondary pain?

Secondary pain is another layer on top of the primary pain. It is the pain we feel because of the way we *think* about painful things. I remember how sad you were when Reilly forgot about your birthday. How do you feel about it now?

Really angry! I don't know why we're friends. Reilly never remembers anything that's important to me.

That's what I thought. You know, a lot of us don't care that Reilly forgets that kind of stuff because we're used to it. That's what we expect to happen, but it's different for you. The forgetting means something different to you.

It means Reilly doesn't give a damn! I don't get why the rest of you don't see that.

I'm sorry that you think about it that way. To me, Reilly's forgetfulness is just forgetfulness, nothing more. You experience this particular secondary pain and I don't because we are thinking about the situation in different ways.

I don't want to talk about Reilly any more.

Fair enough. Do you feel like you understand the difference between primary and secondary pain now?

It seems simple. Primary pain is your raw reaction and secondary pain is about your thinking, but I don't understand why this would be a useful thing to know.

Really? If you knew that what you were feeling was secondary pain and you didn't want to feel it, what could you do about it?

Well, if it's about the way I think about the painful thing then I suppose I could try to change the way I think about it.

Right! And that's why this concept is relevant to mindfulness. When someone practices mindful meditation they try to allow thoughts to come and go without judgement. Noticing what is a thought and what is a feeling can give us great clarity about the things we find painful. For instance we might find that we are trying to push away the sadness of a friend forgetting about us by getting angry at them instead, and in the process actually making life more painful.

... I said I didn't want to talk about that.

You did. I'm sorry. It's a great example though.

I have another question. When someone gets angry or upset, I often get panicky. Sometimes it even happens when I think someone *might* get upset. I notice that other people have different reactions to me. Does that mean that I'm thinking about other people's anger differently? Is this another example of secondary pain?

Can you describe the feeling of panic you get when this happens?

Well, I feel rooted to the spot and I can feel my heart hammering. I feel like somebody might lunge at me at any moment. I feel hyper-aware of what's going on.

That sounds like a fight or flight response.

Are you sure? I never start a fight and I don't think I've ever run away when it has happened.

"Fight or flight" is really an abbreviation. It's a state that happens when we feel we're in immediate danger and the ways we can react are to fight, flee, freeze, or submit.

Well, I guess I freeze in this case, but that doesn't answer my question, is this a primary or secondary pain? It doesn't feel like I have time for my thoughts to get involved but other people don't react the way I do.

If you are having a fight or flight reaction in response to such a normal event as someone being angry, it may be the result of a trauma.

Trauma? That can't be right. Nothing really bad has ever happened to me. I've never been to war, or been in a motorway pile up or anything like that.

It's true that when most people think about trauma they think about obviously horrific events but trauma is broader than that. Trauma rewires a person. It is a way of recording, at a physical level, that a particular occurrence is very dangerous and that we need to be ready for emergency action if it happens again.

But what could be dangerous enough to do that? Nothing in *my* life.

How dangerous something seems depends on the context. Something in the past that was traumatic may look different to you now. You may see it as a normal part of living or of growing up.

If a traumatic event looks normal to me now then I might never figure out what it is. So how do I change what's happening? Sometimes I push through the intense feeling but whatever I do or say doesn't seem to come out right. I always seem to offend someone or make a fool of myself and feel guilty or embarrassed, often both.

The way you are talking about it sounds really vivid.

That's because right now I'm remembering a time that this happened. I feel guilty and embarrased all over again.

Can you describe that feeling?

Too easily! I can feel myself resisting curling into a ball, from the arches of my feet to the back of my neck. I'm remembering what happened and I wish that in my memory I had just stayed silent and unnoticed, or that something really bad had happened to me immediately afterwards so everyone would have had to feel sorry for me and look after me instead of thinking I was an offensive idiot.

It sounds like if you could you would run and hide away.

Definitely!

Then it sounds like what you are feeling is shame.

Yeah, guilt, shame, that kind of thing.

Wait, this is important. Shame is a different thing from guilt.

In what way?

Shame is the feeling that you are unacceptable. It's what you feel when you think you've done something so bad that you need to exclude yourself from society. Shame is the hide-yourself-away emotion and often comes hand-in-hand with trauma. It can make it very hard to ask for help and to trust people to help, because it tells you that you don't deserve help and that anyone who is trying to help you just doesn't realise yet how awful you are. With guilt, regret and remorse, you might reach out to people to try and make amends, but shame tells you to push the rest of the world away.

I like the idea of that; pushing the rest of the world away so that all that's left is me and the trees and birds and no one to else to worry about. I guess what I'm feeling is shame then. I wish things like this didn't happen to me but no matter how careful I am they happen again. Am I ever going to be able to get rid of this feeling?

Trauma is something that psychotherapists often work with. It can take a while. There are things you can do for yourself too. Self-Compassion can be very helpful. My favourite book on that is by Christopher Germer. There are other books too, by Kristen Neff and Paul Gilbert and others. One thing you need to do, which can be *very* tough when you feel you don't deserve it, is to be really, really determined to be kind to yourself.

*sigh* I think I'm going to need help with that. Give me that list of authors again...
