## One free session

As you've probably noticed by now, I am convinced that coaching is a valuable and enriching experience. If you haven't experienced coaching yet then you may be unsure about how useful it would be for you. That's why I give you your first session for free. I want as many people as possible to find out for themselves how useful coaching can be.

Your free session does not commit you to having more coaching. The decision about whether or not to have more coaching is yours.

After the first free session, all subsequent coaching is charged at £30 per session.

If £30 is more than you could consider paying for an hour of life coaching then please talk to me about that. You will still be eligible for one free session.

To arrange your free introductory session please <a href="#contact">get in touch</a> today.
