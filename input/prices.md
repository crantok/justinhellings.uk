## Prices

At the moment I am not charging for coaching. There are several reasons for this:

- The most important reason is that I want to build up a reputation as a coach. This is already working for me. The people I have coached so far are happy to recommend me. If you are coached by me and you find it helpful then I hope that you will do the same. Word of mouth recommendations are very valuable to me.

- I am early in my coaching career. Most coaches find it easiest to market themselves as specialists, branding themselves as "executive coaches", "health coaches", etc. I am not ready to do that and at the moment I want to work with a real variety of people and issues. I can reach the biggest possible range of people by not charging for coaching.

- I still generate enough income from computer work that I can afford to not charge for coaching. This will change. As the number of people who come to me for coaching increases, I will do less computer work and will start to charge for coaching.

When I do start charging for coaching, I intend to use a sliding scale according to people's ability to pay. My guide price will be £50 per session. Some people will not be able to pay this and I will charge them less. If you choose to pay me more than £50 per session then everything you pay over the guide price will go towards pro-bono work with people who cannot afford to pay anything for coaching.
