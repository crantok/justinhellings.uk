## What life coaching can do for you

Do you feel that you need to change something in your life, but you're not sure what? Perhaps you know what you want to do but are not sure how to go about it. Or maybe you've figured all that out but you can't seem to get started. Coaching can help with all these aspects of making a change or starting something new.

Specific things that I can help you with include:

- **Choosing your life goals**. What are the things that really matter to you and how can you shape your life around them?
- **Fine-tuning your work / life balance**. How can you make sure that both your work and the rest of your life get the attention they need?
- **Tackling the things that are holding you back**. What is it that you really want to be doing right now and why isn't that happening?
- **Making decisions when you are at a crossroads**. Do you see paths taking you in different directions and need some perspective on your options?
- **Feeling "stuck" in your life**. Do you feel like you are in a rut and are not sure how to get out?

If you would like help with any of these things then feel free to <a href="#contact">get in touch</a> with me.

## What is a life coach?

A coach is a catalyst for your creativity. Where friends and colleagues will often give advice and opinions, a coach will ask you questions. A coach will work with you to clarify and deepen your understanding of what you want to change, of what you can do to make that happen, and of what is currently holding you back.

## What is it like to be coached?

Coaching is a conversation. You are the expert about the change you want to make (even if you are not sure what it is yet!) and a conversation with a coach can help to clarify goals, generate options, and focus on an achievable plan. With your permission, a coach will hold you accountable for executing your plan. Sometimes that is all we need in order to make a start.

Coaching is not advice. If you expect a coach to tell you what to do then you will be disappointed. A coach is not a mentor who has walked the same path that you now want to follow. A coach will work with you to help you get a clear sense of direction and a realistic plan. That plan might include seeking out the best advice you can get from other professionals.
