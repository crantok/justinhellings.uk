## What life coaching can do for you

Do you feel that you need to change something in your life, but you're not sure what? Perhaps you know what you want to do but are not sure how to go about it. Or maybe you've figured all that out but you can't seem to get started. Coaching can help with all these aspects of making a change or starting something new.

Specific things that I can help you with include:

- **Choosing your life goals**. What are the things that really matter to you and how can you shape your life around them?
- **Fine-tuning your work / life balance**. How can you make sure that both your work and the rest of your life get the attention they need?
- **Tackling the things that are holding you back**. What is it that you really want to be doing right now and why isn't that happening?
- **Making decisions when you are at a crossroads**. Do you see paths taking you in different directions and need some perspective on your options?
- **Feeling "stuck" in your life**. Do you feel like you are in a rut and are not sure how to get out?

If you would like help with any of these things then feel free to <a href="#contact">get in touch</a> with me.

## What is a life coach?

A coach is a catalyst for your creativity. Where friends and colleagues will often give advice and opinions, a coach will ask you questions. A coach will work with you to clarify and deepen your understanding of what you want to change, of what you can do to make that happen, and of what is currently holding you back.

## What is it like to be coached?

Coaching is a conversation. You are the expert about the change you want to make (even if you are not sure what it is yet!) and a conversation with a coach can help to clarify goals, generate options, and focus on an achievable plan. With your permission, a coach will hold you accountable for executing your plan. Sometimes that is all we need in order to make a start.

Coaching is not advice. If you expect a coach to tell you what to do then you may be surprised. A coach is not a mentor who has walked the same path that you now want to follow. A coach will work with you to help you get a clear sense of direction and a realistic plan. That plan might include seeking out the best advice you can get from other professionals.

A coaching session last 60 minutes.

## How many sessions will I need and how often?

Coaching is not usually intended as a long term activity. If you need a lot of support to reach your goals then one of the aims in coaching will be to help you figure out different ways to get that suppport.

A few of my clients have come to me for help with making a single decision and they have only asked for one session. I've also been asked for a single session to help with managing stress in the run-up to an important event.

Most people who I have worked with have had multiple sessions. Often, when we start to make changes in our lives, our specific goals change as our situation changes. Also, when we have dealt with one thing that was holding us back, we can find that other things are not prepared for can get in the way of our new goals.

So, how many sessions? Well, it varies. I think of half-a-dozen sessions as an unsurprising length for a course of coaching. If someone undertook a course of a dozen sessions then I would expect that they had multiple, or particularly challenging, changes to make.

The time between sessions can vary a lot too. You will typically leave a coaching session with some kind of action list. Some of the items may take time to tackle. You probably won't want your next session until you've had time to make progress on your action list, or time to find out that something is holding you back. People who I have coached have taken from a week to a month between sessions. An important consideration is to keep momentum going in order keep a sense of progress. With that in mind, I could imagine the time between sessions being shorter than a week or longer than a month depending on what you were trying to acomplish.
